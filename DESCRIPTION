Description: Implements various heuristics like Take The Best and
    unit-weight linear, which do two-alternative choice: which of
    two objects will have a higher criterion?  Also offers functions
    to assess performance, e.g. percent correct across all row pairs
    in a data set and finding row pairs where models disagree.
    New models can be added by implementing a fit and predict function--
