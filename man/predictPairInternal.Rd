\title{Generic function to predict which of a pair of rows has higher criterion.}
\usage{
predictPairInternal(object, row1, row2)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The object that implements predictPair, e.g. a ttb model.}

\item{row1}{The first row of cues (object$cols_to_fit columns), as a
one-row matrix.}

\item{row2}{The second row of cues.}
}
\value{
A number in the set {-1, 0, 1}, where 1 means row1 is predicted to
  have a greater criterion, -1 means row2 is greater, and 0 is a tie.
}
\description{
Implement this for every heuristic in order to use with row_pair and
aggregate functions.
