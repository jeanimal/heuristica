\title{Predict which of a pair of rows has a higher criterion.
Assumes the object implements predictRoot and has $cols_to_fit.
Experimental.  I will give it a different name later.}
\usage{
predictP2(object, row1, row2)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The object that implements predictPair, e.g. a ttb model.}

\item{row1}{The first row of cues (will apply cols_to_fit for you, based on object).}

\item{row2}{The second row (will apply cols_to_fit for you, based on object).}
}
\value{
A value from 0 to 1, representing the probability that row1's criterion
  is greater than row2's criterion.
