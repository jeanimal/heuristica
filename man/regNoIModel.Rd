\title{Linear regression (no intercept) wrapper for hueristica}
\usage{
regNoIModel(train_matrix, criterion_col, cols_to_fit)
}
\arguments{
\item{train_matrix}{A matrix (or data.frame) of data to train (fit) the model with.}

\item{criterion_col}{The index of the criterion column-- "y" in the formula.}

\item{cols_to_fit}{A vector of column indexes to fit-- the "x's" in the formula.}
}
\value{
An object of class regNoIModel, which is a subclass of lm.
}
\description{
A wrapper to create a lm model just specifying columns, generating
a model formula for you __without an intercept__.
This makes it easier to run automated comparisons with
other models in heuristica.
}
\details{
This version assumes you do NOT want to include the intercept.
Excluding the intercept typically has higher out-of-sample accuracy if the goal is
predicting rank order because the intercept does not affect the ranking, but
estimating it wastes a degree of freedom.
